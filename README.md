<p align='justify'>This repository is dedicated to Machine Learning studies during my student phase of the Mackenzie Postgraduate Course.Some books served as a basis for implementing the contents studied here. Sebastian Raschka and Vahid Mirjalili's book presented the concepts and fundamentals very clearly. I leave here the indication of this material for further studies and that served as studies for this repository.</p>
